          1. Introduction
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-6">
          This Legal Disclaimer ("Disclaimer") governs your participation in the
          pre-sale ("Pre-Sale") of the ERGSEC Renewable Energy Security Token
          ("Token") offered by ERGSEC Oy ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"). By
          participating in the Pre-Sale, you acknowledge and agree to the terms
          set forth herein.

          2. No Offer of Securities
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-6">
          While the Tokens are being offered under the framework of security
          token regulations in applicable jurisdictions, this document and other
          related materials do not constitute a public offer or solicitation to
          buy securities where such offering would be unlawful.

          3. Purpose and Use of Tokens
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-6">
          The Tokens are designed to support platform utility, governance, and
          reward mechanisms within the ERGSEC renewable energy ecosystem. Token
          ownership does not grant equity, voting rights outside the defined
          governance model, or entitlement to future company revenue. Tokens
          facilitate engagement in ESG-focused energy operations and
          decentralized decision-making.
        </p>

          legal and financial professionals to evaluate their obligations.
